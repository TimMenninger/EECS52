Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin because there 
      exists no PT reset signal 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals
