Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin because there 
      exists no PT reset signal 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals 
  
Partitioning logic into 16-input, 16-input with DIs, functions to

34545 WARNING: Net 'OR_968' drives IOCs locked to different megacells or
      different tracks; input logic is duplicated for IOC 'OE1', new 
      input net is 'OR_1124' 
Constant GND drives pin 'DIR1' 
34545 WARNING: Net 'GND_1126' drives IOCs locked to different megacells 
      or different tracks; input logic is duplicated for IOC 'DIR1', 
      new input net is 'GND_1127'
