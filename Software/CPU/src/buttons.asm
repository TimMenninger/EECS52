;Description:      This has the code that handles button presses on the MP3 board by
;                  responding to an interrupt driven by a debouncer.
;
;Contents:         InitButtons - initializes variables to their no-buttons-pushed state
;                  ButtonHandler - responds to an interrupt driven by the debouncer,
;						which interrupts when a button is pressed.
;                  key_available - returns TRUE if a key is ready to be processed and
;						FALSE otherwise
;                  getkey - returns the next valid key ready to be processed and
;						blocks until a valid key is found
;
;Input:            Buttons - this program initializes the keypad and is called by the
;						event handler to scan for buttonpushes, debounce buttons and
;						respond to button pushes.
;
;Output:           None.
;
;Error Handling:   None.
;
;Data Structures:  Queue - This uses a queue to store events that are to occur as results
;						of button presses.

;
;ButtonHandler
;
;Description:       Responds to a pressed button.  This is an interrupt handler
;                   that is called when the button debouncer forces an
;                   interrupt.  It can only process one key at a time, otherwise
;                   the behavior is undefined.
;
;Operation:         To decide which keys are currently being pressed, it inverts
;                   the button read from hardware so that buttons pressed are
;                   represented as 1's.  It then iterates through all of the
;                   bits in this byte and, if it is high, enqueues the key
;                   associated with that button.  To do this, it rotates right
;					and continually checks the most significant bit until iteration
;					reaches as many buttons as there are.  Because the address of
;					the button action table is incremented before first possible
;					access, it is essentially 1-indexed.
;
;Arguments:         None.
;
;Return Value:      None.
;
;Local Variables:   AL - contains key code corresponding to button
;					CX - iteration variable counting bits
;					DL - contains which buttons are pressed
;					DI - address within key table, indexed by button number
;
;Shared Variables:  KeyPresses (WRITE) - Enqueues key events into this queue
;						when key presses are detected.
;
;Global Variables:  None.
;
;Input:             Buttons - Read from to enqueue events associated with
;						pressed buttons.
;
;Output:            None.
;
;Error Handling:    If key pressed corresponds with invalid key, then this
;						does not enqueue anything and continues as if the button
;						were not pressed.
;
;Limitations:       This has undefined behavior if two or more keys are being
;                   pressed.
;
;Algorithms:        None.
;
;Data Structures:   None.

;key_available
;
;Description:       This checks whether there is a key available to be
;                   processed.  If there is, 1 is returned.  Otherwise, 0
;                   is returned.  If there is no key pressed, this clears
;                   the last keys pressed variable.
;
;Operation:         This loads the address of the queue into the register
;                   specified by QueueEmpty then calls QueueEmpty with AX
;                   cleared.  If the zero flag is set by QueueEmpty, then
;                   AX is incremented.  The return value is in AX, which
;                   will be 0 if no key is available and 1 otherwise.
;
;Arguments:         None.
;
;Return Value:      AX - 0 if no key is available (meaning the queue is empty)
;                      and 1 otherwise.
;
;Local Variables:   None.

;get_key
;
;Description:       This gets the next key that is to be processed and returns
;                   it.
;
;Operation:         This loads the queue into the register specified by Dequeue
;                   and dequeues.  Dequeue blocks, so this function doesn't
;                   return until a key is returned.  It then checks the dequeued
;                   key against KEY_ILLEGAL and, if they are equal, tries again.
;                   The key pressed is returned in AX by Dequeue and thus not
;                   moved so that it is also in AX when get_key returns.
;
;Arguments:         None.
;
;Return Value:      AX - The key value that is to be processed next.
;
;Local Variables:   None.
;
;Shared Variables:  KeyPresses (WRITE) - The next key to be processed is
;                      dequeued.
;
;Global Variables:  None.
;
;Input:             None.
;
;Output:            None.
;
;Error Handling:    If the key dequeued is KEY_ILLEGAL, this dequeues the next
;                   key.  If the queue is empty, this blocks until there is a
;                   key is dequeued (the Dequeue function blocks).
