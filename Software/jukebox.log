Optimizing logic... 
  
Trying to move PT reset signal to global reset pin... 
      PT reset signal cannot be moved to global reset pin because there 
      exists no PT reset signal 
      In order to move PT reset signal to global reset pin, the 
      following conditions need to be satisfied: 
      1. There exists at least one pin which drives all register's reset
      signals 
      2. This pin is unlocked 
      3. This pin does not drive any data signals 
      4. This pin can be disjointly decomposed with other pins, if any, 
      which drive reset signals 
  
Partitioning logic into 16-input, 16-input with DIs, functions to 
      minimize delay... 
  
Extracting LXOR2 gates to minimize delay... 
  
Packing functions into GLBs using 16 inputs and 4 outputs per GLB to 
      minimize delay... 
34557 WARNING: Net 'DA1_D' drives IOCs locked to different megablocks; 
      input logic is duplicated for IOC 'IDEE2', new input net is 
      'AND_1151' 
34557 WARNING: Net 'IDECS_D' drives IOCs locked to different megablocks;
      input logic is duplicated for IOC 'IDEE', new input net is 
      'AND_1152'
