# EECS52
This contains my work for EE/CS 52, in which I created and am currently writing
firmware for an MP3 player running on an Intel 80188 processor. I (TimMenninger)
am the only contributor.  When pushing/pulling from a computer in the EE lab,
I unknowingly pushed using a classmate's Git account.
